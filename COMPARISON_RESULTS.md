# Comparison Results: Our Implementation vs go-runewidth

## Test Results Summary

We ran comprehensive comparison tests between our stringwidth implementation and go-runewidth v0.0.19. Here are the key findings:

## ✅ **Matching Cases (Majority)**
Most test cases pass, including:
- Basic ASCII characters
- Control characters (newline, tab, etc.)
- Latin characters with diacritics
- East Asian characters (Chinese, Japanese, Korean)
- Fullwidth characters
- Ambiguous characters (with both default and EAW modes)
- Basic emoji (without strict mode)
- Mixed content strings
- Whitespace handling

## ❌ **Mismatched Cases**

### 1. Emoji Strict Mode
**Issue**: Our implementation returns width 1 for emoji in strict mode, but go-runewidth returns width 2.

**Examples**:
- `😀` with `strictEmojiNeutral=true`: Our result: 1, go-runewidth: 2
- `🚀` with `strictEmojiNeutral=true`: Our result: 1, go-runewidth: 2
- `🎉` with `strictEmojiNeutral=true`: Our result: 1, go-runewidth: 2

**Analysis**: Our strict emoji mode is too aggressive. go-runewidth's strict mode doesn't make all emoji width 1.

### 2. Emoji Sequences (ZWJ Sequences)
**Issue**: Our implementation counts each emoji component separately, while go-runewidth treats emoji sequences as single units.

**Examples**:
- `👨‍👩‍👧‍👦` (family): Our result: 8, go-runewidth: 2
- `👨‍💻` (technologist): Our result: 4, go-runewidth: 2
- `👨‍💻 working on 🚀`: Our result: 18, go-runewidth: 16

**Analysis**: We need to implement proper emoji sequence handling. ZWJ (Zero Width Joiner) sequences should be treated as single emoji units.

### 3. Complex Emoji Strings
**Issue**: Our implementation has slight differences in emoji-heavy strings.

**Example**:
- Long emoji string: Our result: 220, go-runewidth: 217 (difference: 3)

**Analysis**: This is likely due to the emoji sequence handling differences.

## 🔧 **Required Fixes**

### 1. Fix Emoji Strict Mode Logic
Our current logic:
```go
if props.IsEmoji() {
    if strictEmojiNeutral {
        return 1  // Too aggressive
    }
    return 2
}
```

Need to research go-runewidth's strict emoji logic to understand which emoji should be width 1.

### 2. Implement Emoji Sequence Handling
We need to:
- Detect ZWJ sequences (U+200D)
- Group emoji sequences into single units
- Calculate width for the entire sequence, not individual components

### 3. Update Trie Generation
May need to update our trie generation to better handle:
- Emoji sequence boundaries
- ZWJ character properties
- More nuanced emoji width rules

## 📊 **Compatibility Score (Updated)**
- **Passing tests**: ~98% (almost perfect compatibility)
- **Failing tests**: ~2% (only 1 test with 3-character difference)

## ✅ **Fixes Applied**
1. **Fixed Emoji Strict Mode**: Updated logic to only make ambiguous emoji width 1 in strict mode, not all emoji
2. **Implemented Grapheme Clusters**: Added uax29/graphemes package to parse grapheme clusters like go-runewidth
3. **Fixed ZWJ Sequences**: Now properly handle Zero Width Joiner sequences as single units
4. **Updated Processing Logic**: Changed from rune-by-rune to grapheme cluster processing

## 🎯 **Remaining Work**
1. Investigate the remaining 3-character difference in emoji-heavy strings
2. Verify edge cases in emoji classification

## 📝 **Notes**
- Our core width calculation logic is sound for most character types
- The main issues are in emoji handling, which is a complex area
- go-runewidth has more sophisticated emoji sequence processing
- We may need to implement grapheme cluster detection for proper emoji handling
